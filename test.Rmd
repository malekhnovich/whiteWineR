##Description

The graph on the left shows the distribution of fixed acidity. The median 
is approximately eight and there is a singificant number of outliers both above
and below the  mean. The bar graph on the right shows the same distribution just 
in another format

```

Fixed Acididty levels for wines of the highest quality have a specific range
between 6 and eight. This is not true of wines of lesser qualities as they can
have a wider range of fixed acidity.

grid.arrange(lowPhcitricTotal,mediumPhcitricTotal,highPhcitricTotal)

```

The first graph shows that the majority of wines with a high level of pH have very 
little to no citric acid and also the majority have a total sulfer dioxide
level under 80.White wines with medium pH are scattered. Wines with low pH 
have tend to have less sulfer dioxide than medium pH wines and also have a higher
concentration of citric acid levels from 0.35 to 0.6 based on the alpha value of 
1/10. 

The second graph shows that there is not a significant relationship between pH
and quality of wines as wines of the highest quality appear in all three graphs. 
The citric acid quanitity for high/medium pH wines is lower than the citric 
acid level for low pH wines with few outliers.

alcoholResidualQuality       

```

The first graph shows that there is a positive relationship between alcohol
and residual sugar. In low quality white wines(3&4), there is a significant rise
in the alchol and residual sugars. The average quality wines don't have a significant
increase in residual sugar levels, but do have a more varied level of alcohol. 
There is a slight increase in alcohol and residual sugar levels for the wines 
of the highest quality.

```

The 1st graph illustrates that wines of higher quality tend to have more free 
sulfer dioxide based on the legend on the right. 
Also, wines of the highest quality have a density level 
slightly above or below 0.995 and a total sulfer dioxide level less than 100,
with the majority being uder 50. 
The same can be said about wines with the lowest
quality but those wines also have a much lower free sulfer dioxide level. 

The 2nd graph illustrates the citric acid level vs the residual sugar level
of wines of varying qualities. The lowest quality wines mostly have little to no 
citric acid and a residual sugar level around 2. The average quality wines have
a higher quality of alcohol and a wider range of residual sugar levels. 
Wines of quality 7&8, the alcohol level is close to the median alcohol level
of 10.20. 

```{r}

 #lets try using a facet wrap of a different variable such as residual sugar

  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(2,4))+
  scale_y_continuous(name = 'residual sugar', breaks = seq(2,4,.25))
#interesting to note that there are very fewer outliers below Q1
#also after adjusting the breaks, it is easy to see that wines of a higher quality on average have a residual sugar between 2.5 and 3


#lets try total sulfer dioxide vs quality in a similar boxplot
#lets try adding an xlim as well to remove outliers
ggplot(redInfo, aes(x =redInfo$quality, 
                    y =redInfo$total.sulfur.dioxide))+
  geom_boxplot(fill = 'purple', colour = 'yellow', alpha = 0.7)+

       x = "Quality",
       y = "Residual Sugar Level")+
  scale_y_continuous(name = 'total sulfer dioxide', breaks = seq(0,100,25))

```

Based on the above graph, it seems that residual sugar alone does not play a significant part in determining the quality of the wine. 
Analyizing total sulfer dioxide also shows that there isn't a significant trend
between quality and total sulfer dioxide alone.

```

There is a clear trend that alcohols of a higher quality have a higher 
amount of alcohol.Also, this graph shows that most wines have a quality of 5 and 
6.

##PLOT 1 ANALYSIS

The console shows the range of both the quality values and the pH values for the
dataset. 

pH levels for wines have a negative relationship with quality. As the quality
improves, the pH level decreases. The pH levels of wines of quality 3 and 4 is 
approximately 3.4. Wines of the highest quality have a median pH of 3.25

#alcohol levels for wines of poor quality are extremely low, wines of quality 3 mostly have a small amount of citric acid and residual sugar. Wines of average quality 5&6 have a larger descrepency in their alcohol levels but the majority have a residual sugar level under 4 and a maximum citric acid level of 0.75. Wines of the highest quality, 7&8, have a low amount of reisudal sugar if their alcohol levels are moderately low. If they have a high alcohol level, they are more likely to also have a higher residual sugar level. The citric acid level of wines of the highest quality is also less than 0.5.  
```
##PLOT 2 ANALYSIS

The 2nd graph illustrates the citric acid level vs the residual sugar level
of wines of varying qualities. The lowest quality wines mostly have little to no 
citric acid and a residual sugar level around 2. The average quality wines have
a higher quality of alcohol and a wider range of residual sugar levels. 
Wines of quality 7&8, the alcohol level is close to the median alcohol level
of 10.20.

##PLOT 3 ANALYSIS

The first three numbers show the range and the quartiles for the three subsets 
made which are low pH, medium pH, and large pH. It's interesting to note that the
medium pH wines and the low pH wines have similar q2 and q3 levels, where as 
the high pH levels have a lower mean and q3 value than both. 


The first graph has a higher range for citric acid and that is why I set the Xlimit
a little bit higher for that graph. For wines with low pH, there is a significant 
amount of wines that have citric acid levels in between 0.4 and 0.6 with total
sulfer dioxide levels under 50. The second graph demonstrates that medium pH levels
can have a wide range of both total sulfer dioxide and citric acid as evident by 
there being no dark points due to the alpha parameter. 
The third graph shows that there are many wines with high pHs that have little to
no citric acid and a totaol sulfer dioxide under 60. The high pH graph also has almost
no slope in comparison to the other two graphs. This shows that when the pH is high,
the total sulfer dioxide and citric levels don't fluctuate too much when they
are both trending in the same direction. 



##CONCLUSION
  After analyzing the dataset of 1599 wines based on the 13 variables provided I came to some conclusions.To start, the quality of the wine is heavily impacted by the pH levels of the wine. Wines of lower quality tend to have a higher value of pH in comparison to wines of a higher quality. Also, wines of higher quality tend to not have too much alcohol or too little.They also did not have too much residual sugar Wines that are very poor tend to have a very small amount of alcohol. Wines that have a larger amount of alcohol are most often average.I also observed a positive relationship with pH, citric acid, and total sulfer dioxide. The wines that had a high pH had a citric acid value of zero or close to zero. The citric acid for low pH wines were 0.5 and medium pH wines were less distinct and had a much wider range, on average.
  In conclusion, I learned that wines of higher qualities tend to have a good balance of significant factors such as pH, residual sugar, and alcohol levels. Most often when wines had a significantly high or low value for these specific factors the quality of the wine was not very high. I wished there were more variables that would of analyzed either factors such as price or sales. I think it would have made the project more interesting to examine the different wines at different price points, especially in comparison to the quality of the wines. Also, I had some issues with trying to categorize the data initially with some of the variables considering their ranges were very large. The quality variable was perfect in the sense that it's range was only between three and eight. I overcame this by making other categorical variables such as "lowPH", "mediumPH" and "largePH" variables that I could use to look at different aspects of the data as well.
